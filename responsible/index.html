    <h1>Responsible Gambling</h1>
    <p>At Pokies Dreamland, we are committed to promoting responsible gambling practices. Gambling should be an
        enjoyable and entertaining activity, but it's important to be aware of the risks and to gamble responsibly.
        Here, we provide information and resources to help you manage your gambling activities.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Responsible Gambling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Knowing the Risks:</strong> Understanding that gambling involves financial risk and that there is a
            possibility of losing money.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Limits:</strong> Establishing and adhering to financial and time limits for your gambling
            activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintaining Balance:</strong> Ensuring that gambling does not interfere with your personal,
            professional, or social responsibilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Seeking Help:</strong> Recognizing when gambling is becoming a problem and seeking support if
            needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Responsible Gambling</h2>
    <h3>Set a Budget:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Decide how much money you can afford to lose before you start gambling.</li>
        <li>Never chase your losses by betting more than you can afford.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Set Time Limits:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine how much time you can spend on gambling and stick to it.</li>
        <li>Take regular breaks to avoid continuous gambling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Avoid Gambling When Emotional:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t gamble when you are upset, stressed, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</li>
        <li>Make decisions with a clear mind.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Keep Gambling as a Hobby:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Treat gambling as a form of entertainment, not a way to make money.</li>
        <li>Engage in other activities and hobbies to maintain a balanced lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Know the Game:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the rules, odds, and payout structures of the games you play.</li>
        <li>Knowledge can help you make informed decisions.</li>
    </ul>
